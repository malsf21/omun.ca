**Ontario Model United Nations** is a 2 day Model United Nations Conference held at Upper Canada College in Toronto. Ontario's premier MUN conference, OMUN offers a wide range of small to medium sized committees where all delegates, experienced or novice, can try their hand at public speaking, diplomacy, and negotiation. Delegates will assume the role of a nation or figure at various international bodies and domestic organizations, and will use their critical thinking and problem solving skills to find resolutions to some of the most pressing issues facing the world today. OMUN aims to give delegates a valuable window into the world of international relations, and foster discussion and learning on a variety of topics.

Born out of Upper Canada College's previous two events, **UCC Model United Nations** (UMUN) and **Ontario Model Parliament** (OMP), which ran for a combined 40 years, OMUN provides a uniquely Ontarian focus to Model United Nations. Each year, in addition to crisis committees and specialized agencies, OMUN offers a simulation that includes the Ontario provincial government. In this way, OMUN stays true to its roots, and helps educate its delegates on the body that governs Canada's largest province.

OMUN is a unique and exciting conference, with committees tailoring to every delegate: ranging from the General Assembly-sized DISEC, to the Specialized Agencies such as the UNSC, to Crisis-styled committees such as Richard Nixon's Presidential Cabinet.

  The conference is run by true MUN veterans; the secretariat are all members of North America's best MUN delegation, one undefeated at major conferences in more than 3 years (with wins at Harvard (HMUN), Berkeley (BMUN), Columbia (CMUNCE), and McGill (SSUNS)).

OMUN aims to bring forward unparalleled debate and unique solutions. Its delegates will leave the conference with new knowledge, friends, and memories. With the best committees, staff, and delegates in Ontario, we hope to provide the best Model United Nations experience possible.
