## Note from the Vice-Chair

Hello delegates! My name is Evan Enns and I am your Vice-Chair for the Arab League committee at OMUN. I have been doing Model United Nations for 2 years now and have gained amazing experience attending conferences. Our committeeâ€™s topics include terrorism and protecting minorities. These are complex issues that require collaboration between all Arab League member states. I am looking forward to constructive debate and hopefully we can resolve these issues as a committee. Good luck!
