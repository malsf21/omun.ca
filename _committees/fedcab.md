### A Note from the Vice-Chair

Dear Delegates,

Welcome to OMUN II. The Federal Canadian committee will be a simulation of our present Canadian Parliment. We hope you come prepared for some great debate!

My name is Adam Sayani and I will be your vice chair in the Canadian Federal committee. I have been part of the UCC MUN executive and travel team for the past two years. In addition, I am an avid soccer player and very interested in anything with history!

The topics of our committee will be:
1. Canada-US relations
2. Aboriginal Issues
