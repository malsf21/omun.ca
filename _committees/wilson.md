Welcome to the Cabinet of Woodrow Wilson Committee! My name is Ty Greenberg, and I, along with vice-chairs Meg Fanjoy and Anya Murphy, are looking forward to an incredible weekend at OMUN III. Like many of you, the three of us are complete American history buffs, and are very excited to simulate with you all one of the most crucial periods in the history of the United States: the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson and the nationâ€™s involvement in the First World War period. It is 1913, and the United States is a nation on the rise. However, with nationalist tensions stirring across the globe, it is essential that this committee chooses the ideal course of action to ensure that the United States escapes the decade furthering her national interests of global power and universal adherence to the American values of liberty and democracy.
