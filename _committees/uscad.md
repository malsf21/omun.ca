The United States and Canada Joint Cabinet Committee, will attempt to some of the major issues that are currently facing both countries. Because this committee isnâ€™t an actual organization or government body, it will serve as a forum where the ideas of many significant government officials from both Canada and the United States can be shared in order to reach solutions that are going to make both Canada and the United States stronger. While the goal of the committee is to come to joint solutions for the topics at hand, members of the committee must ensure that they are representing the people who elected them into office, and ensure that they are effectively advocating for the policies of their governments.
