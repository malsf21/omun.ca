**A note on Position Papers:** unlike most of the committees at OMUN, the PCPC is a crisis committee, which means that the structure of the committee and the position papers is slightly different. For Position Papers for the PCPC, we request that you write from the perspective of your delegate on your goals throughout the committee session and brief notes on each of the five general issues. The minimum requirement for the paper is just one page, though there is no maximum.

The Politburo of the Communist Party of China is the controlling body of the Chinese government, managing both domestic and international affairs. Ultimately, the goal of this committee is continue the People's Republic of China's rising global superiority through economic, military, and social policy.

Under our great leader Xi Jinping, the PCPC is tasked with engaging with the many threats to China’s security, and the many opportunities for China’s prosperity. They will include (but not be limited to): Chinese Taipei, International Economic Policy, Internal Corruption, Military Influence in Southeast Asia, and Minority Issues.

The PCPC is a crisis committee: delegates will use their individual portfolio powers and the power of their committee to influence the real world, and respond to rapid crises that develop throughout the conference. As such, there will not be any specific topics to discuss, but rather General Issues that are likely to come up in debate and in crisis.
