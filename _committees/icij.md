### Note from the Chair

Hello fellow delegates, my name is Matthew Wang: I'll be the head chair of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, along with vice-chair Phillip Nicoletti. We've had a combined 6+ years of MUN experience, including competing at the international level. We're super excited to be chairing the ICIJ this year! We'll be discussing two relevant and pressing topics as a committee: the Panama Papers and WikiLeaks, and what we can do as a committee to preserve journalistic integrity and to alert people of the injustices happening in the status quo. I'm excited to start reading your position papers and hear your ideas about creating change. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:icij@omun.ca">icij@omun.ca</a>. Good luck preparing for the committee, and we'll see you at OMUN!
