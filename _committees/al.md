Hi! My name is Sammy Fleisher, and I will be one of your co-chairs for the OMUN Arab League Committee. I have been doing Model UN for the past 3 years, attending conferences all over Canada and America at places like Harvard and McGill, and am so excited to finally be able to use all of that knowledge to chair your committee this year. As a graduating student, this may be my last time doing MUN, so I am looking forward to what I hope will be the best committee yet!

In this Arab League committee, I hope that we can engage in thoughtful and stimulating debate about two very important issues - Yemen and Middle Eastern Oil - and collaborate to solve these matters. I am looking forward to seeing you all in a few weeks.
