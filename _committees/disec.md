Dear Delegates,

Welcome to the OMUN First Committee, DISEC!

My name is Gaurav Dogra and I’m super excited to be your chair for OMUN this year! I can’t wait to see what all of you have say about these 2 really interesting topics over the 2-day conference! A little about me: I’m in my third year of MUN at UCC, and really have a passion for it. Like Alex, I’ve been to places like Georgetown, Harvard, and Berkeley for conferences, and this will be my third OMUN! In my free time, I like to learn about technology and businesses, play tennis, read, and sleep -- a lot! Again, I’m super excited for OMUN and I can’t wait to meet you all!

Greetings Delegates! My name is Alexander Lawson and I will be your vice-chair for DISEC. I am a member of the UCC Model UN team, and recently attended the NAIMUN conference in Washington DC. When I am not in class, cycling, or at play rehearsal, I am watching historical documentaries and debating with my friends over whether the Holy Roman Empire really has holy, roman, or even an empire. I am very excited for OMUN, and I hope you all are as well!

See you at OMUN!

Gaurav Dogra and Alexander Lawson
