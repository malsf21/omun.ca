The year is 1963. President John F. Kennedy has been assassinated, and America is in grief and shock over the loss of perhaps their greatest leader in a century. The task of Kennedy’s successor, former Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson, is not an easy one. He must carry on President Kennedy’s legacy while navigating some of the most turbulent times in American history.

### Note from the Vice-Chair

Hi, I'm Charlie, vice-chair of the Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) committee at OMUN and student at UCC.  In LBJ, we'll navigate the aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination -- how to deal with the civil rights movement spreading across America and the growing communist threat in Vietnam.
