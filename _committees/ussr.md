This committee is a collection of the Soviet Socialist Republics, as we decide the collective path forward for our peoples.  It is a difficult period of time for the Soviet Union, both domestically and internationally, but we will surely endure and thrive if the committee works together and makes the right decisions.

A note on committee specifics: The committee will start in the year 1985. Konstantin Chernenko is on his deathbed, which means a new leader will need to be elected or the leadership-structure reformed entirely early in the committee. Instead of splitting the committee sessions into two distinct topics, we will focus on international and domestic issues interchangeably; this should help make debate and crisis more interesting and realistic. Finally, while we encourage delegates to look towards established history (including post-1985) to draw inspiration, please note that we will be simulating an alternate history -- doing the same things as reality will not necessarily have the same result. We, the chairs, are very excited for this committee, and hope you are too. Weâ€™ll see you there!
