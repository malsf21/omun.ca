Dear Delegates,

The UNSC is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations, responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security as well as accepting new members to the United Nations and approving any changes to its United Nations Charter. Its powers include the establishment of peacekeeping operations, the establishment of international sanctions, and the authorization of military action through Security Council resolutions; it is the only UN body with the authority to issue binding resolutions to member states. Our two topics of debate, Korean reunification and the Israel-Palestine conflict are two of the most contentious and polarizing issues in our world today. I am extremely excited to see how all of you work collaboratively to come up with comprehensive solutions to address these pressing issues.

If you have any questions or concerns about the conference, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. Best of luck to all of you, and I am excited to get started on what promises to be a great weekend!

Adam Sayani
