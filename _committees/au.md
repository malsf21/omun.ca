### A Note from the Dais

Hello! My name is Sachin Pasricha and I am an Upper Canada College Graduate who was involved in Model UN and was the Secretary General for the conference in my Grade 12 year. I’ve also competed with the team at conferences at the University of Toronto, Columbia University, McGill University, and the University of California Berkeley. I am in my 1st year of medical school at Queen’s University and remain involved in diplomacy and politics at a more local level, particularly through lobbying efforts with the Ontario Medical Association and the Ontario Medical Students Association.

Hello Everyone!
My name is Gaurav Dogra and I am excited to be your chair for the African UNion for OMUN 2017! I am currently a grade 9 student at Upper Canada College and have been in MUN for around 2 years. I have travelled to McGill, Harvard, and UC Berkeley for MUN conferences and a looking forward to going to new places next season. I am currently interested in business, engineering, and kinesiology but look to keep my options open for the future.

We’re both very excited to watch you all learn, debate, make connections and most importantly: have fun at OMUN 2017. We are also very excited to watch you all apply your MUN skills to the the topics of promoting democracy and economic development over the 2 days.
