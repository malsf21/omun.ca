INTERPOL is an global body that promotes international police cooperation amongst all UN nations. The INTERPOL community, in it’s upcoming session, will be tasked with drafting resolutions that tackle two of the world’s most pressing global issues: cybercrime and trafficking.

Obviously, these two issues transcend national borders, and, therefore, solutions will require international cooperation above all else to be functional. As it is now, cybercrime doesn’t even carry an internationally agreed-upon definition that encompasses what constitutes a cybercrime, and many national policing agencies are reluctant to cooperate with other nations to lessen the detrimental effects of trafficking across the globe. 

Delegates must also consider what INTERPOL’s jurisdiction is with regards to enforcement of these two issues. What can INTERPOL do to take action, all while considering the sovereignty of each UN nation.

Ultimately, INTERPOL is at a crossroads as we will determine how the globe handles two of the most pressing illegal activities in society today, and, as such, we implore all delegates to be creative, but also realistic, in their resolutions.
