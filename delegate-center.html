    <h2>Position Paper Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      A good position paper should properly cover and outline a country or person’s standpoint or views on a specific topic. Your position paper should begin with a brief overview of the topic, your country/person’s stance on the issue and potential solutions to the topic. Proper research is necessary for writing a position paper, and a position paper is often a useful tool to refer to during a conference. In addition to proper research, it is mandatory for all delegates to have citations at the end of their position paper. In addition to ensuring that no plagiarism is involved in the paper, having good sources is vital for proper research and a successful position paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regards to the length and format of position papers at OMUN, all position papers should be around one page in length per topic, single spaced and 11 or 12 point font. Any citations included in a position paper should be in a <a href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html">Chicago-style bibliography</a>. The due date is tentatively <b>March 15, 2018</b>. Be sure to include your name, your school’s name, as well the country that you are representing in a header on your position paper. If you are having any difficulties with writing a position paper or doing research, please refer to the delegate center or feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:omun@ucc.on.ca">omun@ucc.on.ca</a>.
