Hello Delegates and Advisors,

Welcome to the official website of OMUN III! Here, you’ll find everything you need to prepare for Ontario’s premier Model United Nations conference. This year, OMUN III will be using an [online registration system that can be found right here on our website]({{site.regurl}}). For more information on what you can expect from OMUN this year, we encourage you to look through [our diverse range of committees]({{site.baseurl}}/committees). Moreover, if you should have any questions regarding OMUN’s committees, logistics or registration, don’t hesitate to check out our [advisor package]({{site.baseurl}}/files/advisor_package.pdf) or [email us at omun@ucc.on.ca](mailto:omun@ucc.on.ca).

Thanks,

The OMUN Team
