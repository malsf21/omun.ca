Welcome to the OMUN website! Here you'll find information about Ontario Model United Nations, a Model United Nations simulation held at Upper Canada College. You'll learn more about the committees available, general conference information, and about the OMUN staff that works tirelessly to ensure that OMUN is the best conference that it can be!

I'm Matthew Wang, your Under-Secretary General of Communications. I'm also the lead website designer for OMUN, and I'm happy to try my best to make this website (and the conference) to be the best that it can be! If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email at [matthew.wang@ucc.on.ca](mailto:matthew.wang@ucc.on.ca). If you're wondering how I've made this website, you can find our repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/malsf21/omun.ca).
