Hello fellow delegates,

We have two pieces of news discussing background guides and position papers. Firstly, we apologize for the delay on uploading some of the background guides (such as NATO); they have all been uploaded as of this date. They can be found under the committee page for each committee.

Secondly, due to this miscommunication with our background guides, we are pushing back the position paper deadline to April 16. We apologize for the inconvenience, and urge you to contact us if there are any issues.

Thank you very much for choosing to attend OMUN II, and let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Happy preparing!
