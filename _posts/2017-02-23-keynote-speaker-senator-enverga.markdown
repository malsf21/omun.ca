We are pleased to announce that the Keynote Speaker for OMUN II will be Senator Tobias Enverga! Senator Enverga was the first Filipino-Canadian elected to public office in the City of Toronto (as a school trustee for the Toronto Catholic District School Board), and was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 2012. Senator Enverga has previously served as co-chair of the Asian Heritage Month Celebration for the GTA, director of the Canadian Multicultural Council, and president of the Philippine Independence Day Council. He was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012, and we are very excited that he will be able to join us for OMUN II!
