Hello fellow delegates,

As we near the deadline for Position Paper submissions (April 16th, as a reminder), we would like to clarify the position paper submission process. Delegates can find the submission process clearly outlined at the [Delegate Center]({{site.baseurl}}/delegate-center/). In short, we have included committee emails on each committee page: please email the respective email address your position paper, formatted as described in the [Delegate Center section]({{site.baseurl}}/delegate-center/).

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us. Good luck preparing for OMUN II!
