Hey there! If you're reading this guide, that means that you're interested in learning about the OMUN API, which is awesome! Let's take you for a spin.

## What is the OMUN API?

The OMUN API isn't actually a true, server-request based API; it's just a bunch of JSON files generated by `Jekyll` every time the site is built. That being said, a RESTful API might be coming soon!

All the JSON files have both a `structure` and `data` object. The `structure` object will contain the structure of each object inside `data`, including an example `key` and the example `key value`.

```json
structure: {
  "name" : "Name of the Committee",
  ...
},
data: {
  "name" : "United Nations Human Rights Council",
  ...
}
```

`data` will follow the structure set inside `structure.`

### Committee API

The Committee API is an endpoint where developers can grab individual committee information for each committee in OMUN.

You can find documentation on the Committee API [here](api-committee.html).

### Contact API

The Contact API is an endpoint where developers can grab the contact information for OMUN.

You can find documentation on the Contact API [here](api-contact.html).

### More Documentation Coming Soon!

## Uses of the OMUN API

Currently, the API is being used in the development of the [omun app](https://github.com/malsf21/omun-app).
