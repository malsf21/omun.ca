Hey there! If you're reading this guide, that means that you're interested in learning about the OMUN API, which is awesome! Let's take you for a spin.

## What is the OMUN API?

The OMUN API isn't actually a true, server-request based API; it's just a bunch of JSON files generated by `Jekyll` every time the site is built. That being said, a RESTful API might be coming soon!

All the JSON files have both a `structure` and `data` object. The `structure` object will contain the structure of each object inside `data`, including an example `key` and the example `key value`.

```json
structure: {
  "key 1" : "Key 1 value",
  "key 2" : "Key 2 value"
}
```

`data` will follow the structure set inside `structure.`
