        <h2>Ontario's Premier MUN Conference</h2>

  <p>
    <b>Ontario Model United Nations</b> is a 2 day Model United Nations Conference held at Upper Canada College in Toronto. Ontario's premier MUN conference, OMUN offers a wide range of small to medium sized committees where all delegates, experienced or novice, can try their hand at public speaking, diplomacy, and negotiation. Delegates will assume the role of a nation or figure at various international bodies and domestic organizations, and will use their critical thinking and problem solving skills to find resolutions to some of the most pressing issues facing the world today. OMUN aims to give delegates a valuable window into the world of international relations, and foster discussion and learning on a variety of topics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Born out of Upper Canada College's previous two events, UCC Model United Nations (UMUN) and Ontario Model Parliament (OMP), which ran for a combined 40 years, OMUN provides a uniquely Ontarian focus to Model United Nations. Each year, in addition to crisis committees and specialized agencies, OMUN offers a simulation that includes the Ontario provincial government. In this way, OMUN stays true to its roots, and helps educate its delegates on the body that governs Canada's largest province.
  </p>

  <p>
    OMUN is a unique and exciting conference, with committees tailoring to every delegate: ranging from the General Assembly-sized WHO or DISEC, to the Specialized Agencies such as the UNSC or FAO, to Crisis-styled committees such as Richard Nixon's Presidential Cabinet or the Medellin Cartel.
  </p>

  <p>
    The conference is run by true MUN veterans; the secretariat are all members of North America's best MUN delegation, one undefeated at major conferences in more than 3 years (with wins at Harvard (HMUN), Berkeley (BMUN), Columbia (CMUNCE), and McGill (SSUNS)).
  </p>

  <p>
    OMUN aims to bring forward unparalleled debate and unique solutions. Its delegates will leave the conference with new knowledge, friends, and memories. With the best committees, staff, and delegates in Ontario, we hope to provide the best Model United Nations experience possible.

  <i>This year is the second session of OMUN (OMUN II). Last year was the first session of OMUN I; you can read a recap below.</i>

  <h3>About OMUN I (2016)</h3>

  <p>
    OMUN I was a great success. The 250+ delegates attending from 20 schools around Ontario had an incredible time debating a wide array of issues. With committees ranging from the World Health Organization to NATO to the Medellin Cartel, OMUN I succeeded in both provoking great debate and inspiring incredible solutions. <i>Congratulations go to the Oakville Trafalgar School</i> for winning Best Large Delegation. Commendations are also in order for all of the delegates who attended, as their hard work and dedication paid off to create an amazing weekend. We can't wait to see you all at OMUN II!
