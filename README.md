# Ontario Model United Nations Coming Soon Website

Hey there, you've visited the repository of the Ontario Model United Nations website! Here you can see how all of our code works, and take a sneak peek of new features.

The "comming-soon" landing page is in the `coming-soon` branch, and is what is currently at [omun.ca](http://omun.ca/).

The official OMUN III website is in the `master` branch; that being said, it's not live. 

This website uses use [Liteweight](https://github.com/malsf21/liteweight/), which is a CSS framework that I wrote with @obrien66. We also use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.io), which is an icon font set. 

## Setup

Want to run your own coming-soon page? Easy as cake, all you need to do is clone this repository, and open it up in a web browser.

And voila! Everything should work for you. If something isn't, please let me know on our [issues tracker](https://github.com/malsf21/omun.ca/issues).
