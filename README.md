# Ontario Model United Nations Website

Hey there, you've visited the repository of the Ontario Model United Nations website! Here you can see how all of our code works, and take a sneak peek of new features.

The test and development version of this website, in `master`, is hosted at [my website](http://matthewwang.me/omun/). It'll have the latest working version of master.

~~The official, `stable` version of the website is in the `stable` branch, and is hosted at [omun.ca](http://omun.ca/)~~ Currently no stable branch, since I'm reworking from scratch.

The "comming-soon" landing page is in the `coming-soon` branch, and is what is currently at [omun.ca](http://omun.ca/).

This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static-site generator, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), a CSS library, and [jQuery](http://jquery.com), a Javascript Library, among other small tools to make this website as awesome as it is!

## Setup

Want to run your own coming-soon page? Easy as cake, all you need to do is clone this repository, and open it up in a web browser.

And voila! Everything should work for you. If something isn't, please let me know on our [issues tracker](https://github.com/malsf21/omun.ca/issues).
