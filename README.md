# Ontario Model United Nations Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/malsf21/omun.ca.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/malsf21/omun.ca)

Hey there, you've visited the repository of the Ontario Model United Nations website! Here you can see how all of our code works, and take a sneak peek of new features.

# Branches and Versioning

`master` is the latest stable development release of the website. The latest working version is held at [the test domain](http://test.omun.ca). In addition, hotfixes that are pushed to `master` are also hosted at the offical domain, [omun.ca](http://omun.ca/).

`stable` is the most stable release of the website. It typically will be mirrored at the offical domain, [omun.ca](http://omun.ca/). Developers looking to make their own websites off of this project should clone a stable release.

`coming-soon` is a landing page designed for OMUN when the offical site was not yet live. While it is no longer live on any domain, you can re-use it as you wish.

# Software

This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static-site generator, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), a CSS library, and [jQuery](http://jquery.com), a Javascript Library, among other small tools to make this website as awesome as it is!

# Documentation

Documentation of this website is [here](http://omun.ca/docs/); alternatively, you can browse the `docs` folder (but it isn't a complete experience)!

## API Documentation

The API itself is still a work in progress. Because of that, the API is not documented very well, and is not recommended for production use.

# Setup

Visit [this link](http://omun.ca/docs/setup.html) or browse the `_docs/setup.md` file to learn how to setup the OMUN website on a local machine.
