# Ontario Model United Nations Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/malsf21/omun.ca.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/malsf21/omun.ca)

Hey there, you've visited the repository of the Ontario Model United Nations website! Here you can see how all of our code works, and take a sneak peek of new features.

# Branches and Versioning

`master` is the latest stable development release of the website. Normally, `master` is live on the the offical domain, [omun.ca](http://omun.ca/)

`coming-soon` is a landing page that's currently up at [omun.ca](https://omun.ca). When the conference gets closer, we switch to `stable`.

# Software

This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static-site generator, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), a CSS library, and [jQuery](http://jquery.com), a Javascript Library, among other small tools to make this website as awesome as it is!

# Documentation

Documentation of this website is [here](http://omun.ca/docs/); alternatively, you can browse the `docs` folder (but it isn't a complete experience)!

## API Documentation

The API itself is still a work in progress. Because of that, the API is not documented very well, and is not recommended for production use.

# Setup

Visit [this link](http://omun.ca/docs/setup.html) or browse the `_docs/setup.md` file to learn how to setup the OMUN website on a local machine.
