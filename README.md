# Ontario Model United Nations Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/malsf21/omun.ca.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/malsf21/omun.ca)

Hey there, you've visited the repository of the Ontario Model United Nations website! Here you can see how all of our code works, and take a sneak peek of new features.

The test and development version of this website, in `master`, is hosted at [the test domain](http://test.omun.ca). It'll have the latest working version of master.

The official, `stable` version of the website is in the `stable` branch, and is hosted at [omun.ca](http://omun.ca/)

The "coming-soon" landing page is in the `coming-soon` branch, and is what was at [omun.ca](http://omun.ca/) before production was finished.

This website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static-site generator, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), a CSS library, and [jQuery](http://jquery.com), a Javascript Library, among other small tools to make this website as awesome as it is!

# Documentation

Documentation of this website is [here](http://omun.ca/docs/); alternatively, you can browse the `docs` folder (but it isn't a complete experience)!

# Setup
