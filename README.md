# Ontario Model United Nations Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/malsf21/omun.ca.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/malsf21/omun.ca)

Hey, welcome to the repository of the OMUN website from 2017 and 2018 (OMUN II & OMUN III). After 2018, the OMUN team moved away from having a website developed by the student team; therefore, what you'll find here is not what's on omun.ca right now.

This website was built by Matthew Wang (@malsf21), USG Communications from 2015-2018 and member of UCC's MUN team. It was built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).

## Setup

Visit [this link](http://malsf21.github.io/omun.ca/docs/setup.html) or browse the `_docs/setup.md` file to learn how to setup the OMUN website on a local machine.

## Branches

* `2018` and `2017` are the states of the project after OMUN II and OMUN III respectively
* `master` is a functional mirror of `2018`, with just the README changed
* `gh-pages` is a slightly modified version of `2018` to work properly with GitHub pages
* `coming-soon` is a coming soon page used for OMUN III
